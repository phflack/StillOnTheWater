YOUR MEMORIES DIED WITH THE MOMENTS THEY TRIED TO SUSTAIN
IN SPITE OF YOUR MEMORY, NOTHING IS PRESERVED
OBJECTS HAVE NO STORIES TO TELL, ONLY YOU DO, BUT YOU SUCK AT IT.
NO MATTER WHAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND...
YOUR MEMORIES WILL FAIL TO REPRESENT
THE TIME THEY TOOK TO FORM
... AND MAYBE SOMEONE WILL LEARN OF A TINY FRACTION OF YOUR LIFE
AND, WRONGLY
THEY'LL THINK THEY KNEW YOU
